<p> THYMU is a reminder app with a twist - it notifies you of your monthly bills right when they're due, your water consumption every day, personal medication reminders, and even reminds you when it's that time of the month. With all the stress in our lives today, doesn't it feel good to have someone help remind us what needs to get done?</p>

The growth of smartphones has continued unabated. The average user spends two hours per day using the device, of which only around 11 minutes are spent making phone calls.
